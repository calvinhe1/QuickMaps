# QuickMaps

QuickMaps is mapping software that provides detailed information about geographical regions worldwide, largely inspired by Google Maps. This project was written using C++, and utilizes the OpenStreetMap API for its data source, and EZGL and GTK graphics libraries for the user interface.

NOTE: This project is written for the school course ECE297, so the source code will not be made public.

# Main Features

* QuickMaps provides visualization of all geographic features (roads, buildings, points of interest, subway stations, bus routes, street names, etc.)
* User-interactive controls
    * The keyboard or the built-in buttons can allow the user to move around the map and zoom in/out to view the map more clearly
* Searching path feature
    * Provide two intersections, and the shortest path will be generated between the two points
    * The path is visualized in the UI and the directions to go from point A to point B are shown in the sidebar
    * The Djikstraâ€™s pathfinding algorithm was implemented to help find the shortest path
* Find feature
    * By providing an intersection, street, or point of interest (e.g. restaurants, schools), the application will find and zoom into the location
